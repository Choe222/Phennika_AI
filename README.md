MULTI-TASK LEARNING

This project addresses the challenge of classifying user reviews and predicting sentiment ratings for specific labels. Built upon a robust architecture, our model integrates the PhoBERT Encoder with two dedicated modules for classification and scoring.

It demonstrates superior performance, achieving approximately 94.9% Micro-F1 in classification and 86.9% in Sentiment Score accuracy.
